WEEK 7 –MULTI-ARMED BANDITS-MOVIE RECOMMENDATION

1.Write down the “Movie Recommendation”as a Reinforcement Learning problemformulation.Use comment lines for proper documentation. 

2.For the environment, use the built-in TF-agentagent, MovieLensPyEnvironment(non-per-arm)
https://github.com/tensorflow/agents/blob/master/tf_agents/bandits/environments/movielens_py_environment.py

3.Compute the regretusing the built-in metric in TF-agents
https://github.com/tensorflow/agents/blob/master/tf_agents/bandits/metrics/tf_metrics.py

4.Plottheregret against 20,000-timestepsusing thebuilt-in agents: 
a.LinUCB
b.LinTS
c. NeuralEpsilonGreedy
And identify the best agent for the movie recommendation

5.Write the Recommendation policy, givena new observation request (i.e. a user vector), the policy will produceactions, which are the recommended movies.
